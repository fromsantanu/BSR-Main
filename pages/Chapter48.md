# Chapter: Python (Libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels)

## Introduction

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that has become one of the most popular tools for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. Python's simplicity, combined with its extensive ecosystem of libraries, makes it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced data scientists. In this chapter, we will explore some of the most widely used Python libraries for data manipulation, numerical computing, and statistical analysis, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `statsmodels`.

## Key Python Libraries

1. **pandas**:
   - `pandas` is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are essential for handling and analyzing structured data.
   - Common operations with `pandas` include data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, and reshaping.

2. **numpy**:
   - `numpy` is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
   - `numpy` is highly optimized for performance and is widely used in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.

3. **scipy**:
   - `scipy` builds on `numpy` by adding a collection of algorithms and functions for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and more.
   - `scipy` is often used for more advanced mathematical computations and scientific research.

4. **statsmodels**:
   - `statsmodels` is a library for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing in Python. It provides tools for estimating and testing statistical models, including linear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, and more.
   - `statsmodels` is particularly useful for conducting rigorous statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

## Example 1: Data Manipulation with pandas

Let's start with an example of how to use `pandas` for data manipulation.

### Python Code: Data Manipulation with pandas

```python
# Import necessary library
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45],
    'Score': [85, 90, 95, 80, 88]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# View the first few rows of the DataFrame
print("Head of the DataFrame:")
print(df.head())

# Filter rows where Age is greater than 30
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 30]
print("\nFiltered DataFrame (Age > 30):")
print(filtered_df)

# Add a new column with Score squared
df['Score_Squared'] = df['Score'] ** 2
print("\nDataFrame with new column (Score_Squared):")
print(df)

# Group by 'Age' and calculate the mean Score
grouped_df = df.groupby('Age')['Score'].mean()
print("\nMean Score by Age:")
print(grouped_df)

# Merge with another DataFrame
additional_data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']
}
additional_df = pd.DataFrame(additional_data)
merged_df = pd.merge(df, additional_df, on='Name')
print("\nMerged DataFrame:")
print(merged_df)
```

### Explanation

- **Creating a DataFrame**: A sample DataFrame is created with columns `Name`, `Age`, and `Score`.
- **Filtering**: Rows are filtered based on the condition that `Age` is greater than 30.
- **Adding a Column**: A new column `Score_Squared` is added by squaring the `Score` column.
- **Grouping**: The DataFrame is grouped by `Age`, and the mean `Score` is calculated for each group.
- **Merging**: The DataFrame is merged with another DataFrame containing `Name` and `City` columns.

### Output

The output will display the original DataFrame, the filtered DataFrame, the DataFrame with the new column, the grouped DataFrame, and the merged DataFrame.

## Example 2: Numerical Computing with numpy

Next, let's explore how to use `numpy` for numerical computing.

### Python Code: Numerical Computing with numpy

```python
# Import necessary library
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
array_sum = np.sum(array)
array_mean = np.mean(array)
array_std = np.std(array)
array_squared = np.square(array)

print("Original Array:", array)
print("Sum:", array_sum)
print("Mean:", array_mean)
print("Standard Deviation:", array_std)
print("Squared Array:", array_squared)

# Create a 2D numpy array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Perform matrix operations
matrix_transpose = np.transpose(matrix)
matrix_inverse = np.linalg.inv(matrix + np.eye(3))  # Add identity matrix to make it invertible
matrix_dot_product = np.dot(matrix, matrix_transpose)

print("\nOriginal Matrix:\n", matrix)
print("Transposed Matrix:\n", matrix_transpose)
print("Inverse Matrix:\n", matrix_inverse)
print("Dot Product of Matrix and its Transpose:\n", matrix_dot_product)
```

### Explanation

- **Creating an Array**: A `numpy` array is created, and basic arithmetic operations such as sum, mean, standard deviation, and squaring are performed.
- **Matrix Operations**: A 2D array (matrix) is created, and operations like transpose, inverse (after making the matrix invertible), and dot product are demonstrated.

### Output

The output will display the results of the arithmetic operations on the array and the matrix operations.

## Example 3: Scientific Computing with scipy

Let's see how `scipy` can be used for more advanced scientific computations.

### Python Code: Scientific Computing with scipy

```python
# Import necessary library
from scipy import optimize
import numpy as np

# Define a quadratic function
def quadratic_function(x):
    return x**2 + 4*x + 4

# Find the minimum of the function using scipy's optimize module
result = optimize.minimize(quadratic_function, x0=0)
print("Minimum of the function:")
print("x =", result.x)
print("Function value =", result.fun)

# Integration example
from scipy import integrate

# Define a function to integrate
def integrand(x):
    return np.exp(-x**2)

# Perform the integration
result, error = integrate.quad(integrand, 0, np.inf)
print("\nIntegration result (exp(-x^2) from 0 to infinity):")
print("Result =", result)
print("Estimated error =", error)
```

### Explanation

- **Optimization**: The `optimize` module from `scipy` is used to find the minimum of a quadratic function.
- **Integration**: The `integrate` module is used to perform numerical integration of a function over a specified range.

### Output

The output will display the minimum of the quadratic function and the result of the numerical integration, along with the estimated error.

## Example 4: Statistical Modeling with statsmodels

Finally, let's explore how to use `statsmodels` for statistical modeling.

### Python Code: Statistical Modeling with statsmodels

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataset
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100)
y = 3 * X + np.random.randn(100) * 0.5

# Add a constant term for the intercept
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print the summary of the model
print(results.summary())

# Predict the response using the model
y_pred = results.predict(X)

# Create a DataFrame to display actual vs. predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y, 'Predicted': y_pred})
print("\nActual vs. Predicted Values:")
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation

- **Dataset Creation**: A synthetic dataset is created for a simple linear regression problem.
- **Model Fitting**: An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model is fitted using `statsmodels`.
- **Model Summary**: The summary of the regression model, including coefficients, R-squared, and p-values, is printed.
- **Prediction**: The model is used to predict the response, and the actual vs. predicted values are displayed.

### Output

The output will display the summary of the regression model and a table showing the actual vs. predicted values.
